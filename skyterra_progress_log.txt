# SkyTerra Progress Log

## Audit Summary (2025-06-28)

This log tracks the systematic audit and improvement of the SkyTerra platform. Each entry represents a concrete task performed.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **(Infra) Initial Project Cleanup:**
    - Removed duplicate `.env.example`.
    - Corrected `.gitignore` to properly ignore the `media` directory.
    - Standardized startup scripts (`.sh` and `.bat`) for portability and correctness.
    - Removed redundant root `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
    - Pinned `stripe` dependency in `requirements.txt` to version `12.2.0`.

- [x] **(Frontend) Refactored `Login.jsx` Component:**
    - **Problem:** Hardcoded API URLs, no-op email login, no user feedback or error handling.
    - **Fix:** Replaced hardcoded URLs with centralized config. Implemented API call logic for email login using `axios`. Added loading indicators (`CircularProgress`) and error display (`Alert`) for better UX.

- [x] **(Backend) Optimized Property List Endpoint (`PropertyViewSet`):**
    - **Problem:** N+1 query issue causing excessive database calls when fetching property lists.
    - **Fix:** Implemented `select_related('owner')` and `prefetch_related('images')` to efficiently load related objects, drastically reducing DB queries.

- [x] **(Backend) Optimized Property List Payload:**
    - **Problem:** `PropertyListSerializer` included the large `boundary_polygon` field, increasing payload size unnecessarily.
    - **Fix:** Removed `boundary_polygon` from the list serializer. It remains available in the detail view (`PropertySerializer`).

- [x] **(Backend) Critical Security Fix in `PropertyViewSet`:**
    - **Problem:** Missing object-level permission checks allowed any authenticated user to `DELETE` any property.
    - **Fix:** Created a reusable `IsOwnerOrAdmin` permission class. Applied it to the `PropertyViewSet` to ensure only the owner or an admin can modify or delete a property. Refactored the view to remove redundant manual checks.

- [x] **(Backend) Implemented Stripe Webhook and Subscription Management:**
    - **Problem:** No reliable mechanism to track user subscriptions or confirm payments from Stripe. Missing webhook endpoint.
    - **Fix:** Created `Subscription` model to store user subscription status. Implemented `StripeWebhookView` to securely handle Stripe events (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`). Updated `CreateCheckoutSessionView` to reuse existing Stripe customer IDs.

- [x] **(Backend) Audited and Secured `support_tickets` App:**
    - **Problem 1:** `TicketResponseViewSet` only allowed admins to view responses, preventing users from seeing replies to their own tickets.
    - **Fix 1:** Modified `TicketResponseViewSet` permissions and queryset to allow authenticated users to view responses to their own tickets, while admins can view all.
    - **Problem 2:** `TicketViewSet` had redundant and less secure permission logic, potentially allowing unauthorized access to ticket details.
    - **Fix 2:** Refactored `TicketViewSet` to use the `IsOwnerOrAdmin` permission class for modification/deletion, ensuring proper object-level security. Simplified `get_queryset` as the permission class now handles authorization.

- [x] **(Frontend) Improved `PropertyDetails.jsx` Component:**
    - **Problem 1:** Typo in `Login.jsx` (`e.targe.value`) prevented password input.
    - **Fix 1:** Corrected typo to `e.target.value`.
    - **Problem 2:** `isFavorited` state was incorrectly destructured, causing favorite functionality to fail.
    - **Fix 2:** Corrected `useState` destructuring.
    - **Problem 3:** Property images were hardcoded/simulated instead of fetched from the backend.
    - **Fix 3:** Implemented fetching real images using `imageService.getPropertyImages(id)`.
    - **Problem 4:** Unused `countryFlightPaths` variable.
    - **Fix 4:** Removed dead code.
    - **Problem 5:** `axios.post('/api/property-visits/')` used a relative URL, potentially failing in production.
    - **Fix 5:** Updated to use `config.api.baseURL` for robustness.
    - **Problem 6:** `Pano2VRViewer` was rendered multiple times, impacting performance.
    - **Fix 6:** Refactored to render a single `Pano2VRViewer` instance and use a selection mechanism for tours.

- [x] **(Frontend & Backend) Implemented Persistence for Additional Property Fields:**
    - **Problem:** `PropertyForm.jsx` collected data for `terrain`, `access`, `legalStatus`, and `utilities`, but these were not persisted to the backend.
    - **Fix:**
        - Added `terrain`, `access`, `legal_status`, and `utilities` fields to the `Property` model in `backend/properties/models.py`.
        - Created and applied new database migrations for these model changes.
        - Updated `PropertySerializer` in `backend/properties/serializers.py` to include the new fields.
        - Updated `initialFormState` and `useEffect` in `PropertyForm.jsx` to correctly handle these fields.
        - Modified `handleChange` in `PropertyForm.jsx` to manage the `utilities` array.
        - Updated `preparePropertyData` in `frontend/src/services/api.js` to correctly map and send these new fields to the backend.

- [x] **(Backend) Unit Test for `IsOwnerOrAdmin` Permission:**
    - **Problem:** Critical security permission lacked dedicated unit tests.
    - **Fix:** Created `backend/skyterra_backend/tests/test_permissions.py` with a comprehensive `APITestCase` to verify `IsOwnerOrAdmin` behavior for various user roles and HTTP methods. Tests passed successfully.

### Next Steps & Recommendations

#### P1: High-Priority Tasks

1.  **User Experience (UX) & UI Review - Property Creation/Editing Flow:**
    - **Objective:** Improve usability and create a more polished user interface for the property creation and editing process.
    - **Next Action:** Conduct a full walkthrough of the property creation and editing flow, focusing on `CreateProperty.jsx` and `PropertyForm.jsx`, to identify UI inconsistencies, confusing interactions, and areas for improved user guidance.

#### P2: Medium-Priority Tasks

2.  **Documentation Overhaul:**
    - **Objective:** Create clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date documentation.
    - **Next Action:** Begin by rewriting the root `README.md` to reflect the current state of the project and provide clear setup instructions.

#### P3: Low-Priority Tasks

3.  **Testing Strategy Enhancement:**
    - **Objective:** Increase test coverage and ensure application stability.
    - **Next Action:** Write a unit test for the new `IsOwnerOrAdmin` permission class to ensure it behaves as expected.
